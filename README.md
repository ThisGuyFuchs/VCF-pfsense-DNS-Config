# VCF-pfsense-DNS-Config
I like to use pfsense for nested VCF deployments as it is not resource intensive, can handle NTP and DNS, quick to stand up, and can load config files equally as fast. This is a XML backup of my pfsense DNS Resolver config to match the VCF XLSX workbook IP addresses, intended for use within a lab environment, assuming the WAN port is on your home network and the LAN port addresses the 172.16.11.x network on your lab subnet. You can of course change this to suit your needs. I would suggest making sure that the LAN address matches the workbook (172.16.11.253), or change the workbook config to match. Load the XML through Diagnostics > Backup & Restore > Restore Backup, choose "DNS Resolver" from the drop down menu, and then click "Restore Configuration". I prefer using the workbook defaults so that I don't have to configure a bunch of IP addresses and DNS entries.
